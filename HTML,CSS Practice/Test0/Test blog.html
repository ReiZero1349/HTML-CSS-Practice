		<h2><b><u>Taj Mahal</u></b></h2>
		<p class="quote">Situated on the banks of Yamuna, the Taj Mahal in Agra is a monumental ode to eternal love. This 17th-century mausoleum was built for Mumtaz Mahal by her husband and Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. Regarded as one of the most beautiful buildings in the world, the Taj brilliantly represents the height of Mughal architecture and grandeur. Such is its beauty that it has been recognized as one of the <span id="wonders"> Seven Wonders of the Modern World.</span> </p>

		<h4><b><u>Taj Mahal: History </u></b></h4>

		<p id="History">The Taj Mahal, the grandest mausoleum the world has ever seen, was commissioned by Shah Jahan, the Mughal Emperor, for his favorite wife Mumtaz Mahal.  The construction of the mausoleum commenced in 1632, around a year after Mumtaz died, on the banks of the Yamuna River. Though the main mausoleum was constructed by 1643, it wasnâ€™t until 1653 that the whole complex was completed. Unfortunately, the emperor was overthrown from power and imprisoned by his son Aurangzeb in 1658. Shah Jahan spent his last days in imprisonment in the nearby Agra Fort from where he looked at his marvellous creation. When he died in 1666, he was buried inside the Taj Mahal, beside his loved wife.

		When the Jat rulers of Bharatpur raided Agra in the 18th century, they invaded the Taj and plundered it. During the Revolution of 1857, this memorial suffered damage at the hands of the British soldiers and officials, who removed the precious stones from its walls.

		The Taj Mahal underwent massive restoration works in the early part of the 20th century under the command of Lord Curzon, the then Viceroy of India. After independence, the monument came under the aegis of the Government of India.</p>

		<h4><b><u>Taj Mahal: Architecture </u></b></h4>

		<p id="Architecture">A universally admired masterpiece of art, the Taj Mahal combines elements from Islamic, Persian, and Indian architectural styles. The monument covers an area of 42 acres, bounded by crenelated walls on three sides and the Yamuna on the fourth side. It was constructed using white Makrana marble sourced from Rajasthan. Thousands of precious and semi-precious gemstones were also used to enhance the beauty of the memorial.

		The Taj Mahal stands on an elevated square plinth that has four minarets standing at the four corners. The symmetrical building housing the crypts has an arch-shaped entryway that sits below a colossal dome and finial. Inside the main hall of the mausoleum, you can see the false sarcophagi of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal. The actual tombs are located inside a locked chamber at a lower level.

		While the external decorations of the monument testify to the Mughal craftsmanship, the interiors are equally dazzling. The octagon-shaped inner chamber features jali bordering and quotations from the Quran on the cenotaphs and intricate decorative details featuring twining vines, flowers, and fruits, highlighted with 28 kinds of precious and semiprecious stones. Though the base and casket are delicately decorated, the crypts where the main bodies are kept are rather plain, in keeping with the Islamic tradition. 

		It took more than 22000 skilled artisans, laborers, painters, stonecutters, and a huge amount of 32 million rupees to build the Taj Mahal. Apart from the mausoleum, the Taj complex houses a mosque, a museum, a guest house, and ornamental gardens.</p>
